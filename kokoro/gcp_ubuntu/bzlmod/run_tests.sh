# Builds and tests tink-cc and its examples using Bazel's bzlmod.
#
# The behavior of this script can be modified using the following optional env
# variables:
#
# - CONTAINER_IMAGE (unset by default): By default when run locally this script
#   executes tests directly on the host. The CONTAINER_IMAGE variable can be set
#   to execute tests in a custom container image for local testing. E.g.:
#
#   CONTAINER_IMAGE="us-docker.pkg.dev/tink-test-infrastructure/tink-ci-images/linux-tink-cc-base:latest" \
#     sh ./kokoro/gcp_ubuntu/bzlmod/run_tests.sh
#
set -euo pipefail

# TODO(b/292091379) Tentatively a noop. Remove this from Kokoro
